# Inspiring Art Published On Swarm # 
<i>Decentralized storage has many properties different to classical ways of publishing. In case of Swarm, certain levels of redundancy are guaranteed by its very design, as well as censorship resistant properties that stem from the fact that data is spread between peers and not in a central location. Art can take many different forms, depending what mirrors the current stat of the society best.</i>
  
The Internet was conceived as a network of interconnected networks in which any node of the network can communicate with all the others. However, with Web 1.0 <i>(red)</i>, we have observed an ultra-centralization of the Internet in terms of its infrastructure, its services and its information. The architecture of the Web 2.0 <i>(blue)</i> is itself characterized by the presence of data centralization poles, indeed we still observe this centralization of information and services by Internet giants such as Google and Facebook that own data processing servers. There is hope with the emergence of Web 3.0 <i>(green)</i>, with the advent of blockchains and their networks of nodes, the architecture of Web 3.0 tends to become entirely decentralized, unstoppable and concerned with the preservation of the privacy of its users who wish it. 

Through this 18 seconds animated gif, I wanted to illustrate this structural evolution of our Internet network over the last 30 years.
